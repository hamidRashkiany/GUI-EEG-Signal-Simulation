<h1>EEG Signal Simulation</h1>
Release Version1 of EEG Signal Simulator (GUI Version).<br>
This is the first iteration of a GUI simulator for EEG signals. This product is great for neuroscience students who want to get a better handle on the different components of an electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. An EEG signal is made up of four main signals: delta, alpha, beta and theta. Each one has its own characteristics. This GUI lets you easily simulate an EEG signal and see a visual demonstration of an EEG signal. It was developed using pure Python and runs on your machine. You just need to install a few packages to get it up and running. All the packages you need are listed in the requirement.txt file.
